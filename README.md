<h1>Traffic Signal Front-end Machine Coding:</h1>

This project is a front-end implementation of a traffic signal using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It simulates the behavior of a traffic signal by displaying different colors for each signal phase (red, yellow, and green) and controlling their timings.

## Features :

- üö¶ Displays a visual representation of a traffic signal with three signal lights (red, yellow, and green).

- ‚è±Ô∏è Simulates the behavior of a traffic signal by changing the signal light colors based on predefined timings.

Technologies Used
- HTML: Used for structuring the web page and defining the layout.
- CSS: Used for styling the traffic signal and providing visual effects.
- JavaScript: Used for implementing the logic and controlling the behavior of the traffic signal.
